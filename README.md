# RadiFlux
A user-friendly graphical interface to model physical processes in ice-covered lakes


# Abstract
Accurate modeling of the water temperature in freshwater ice-covered lakes is critical for predicting the
movement of phytoplankton and nutrients driven by solar-powered water motion. As light is allowed to
propagate through the ice, it is absorbed and heats the near-ice water increasing both the temperature and
density of cold water to form a mixing layer at the ice cover. The goal is to create a user-friendly webpage
to allow users to change external parameters such as solar intensity, along with lake characteristics such
as depth and ice composition, to predict the onset of this mixing. Utilizing advanced mathematics, the
webpage will be built using Python, with an easy-to-use graphical interface to observe the evolution of
the water temperature and to predict the onset of solar-powered mixing from user-input data.
